before you do anything, update the ROOT variable in settings.py to be the
absolute path of current folder. no slash '/' at the end.

if you want to use emulator, run
    $ ./emulate.py

if you want to use simulator, you have two ways:
    1. going to NS3 path and type:
        $ ./waf shell
       you will enter ns3 waf-sh. Then in this shell, go back to this folder and type
        $ ./simulate.py
    2. if you are lazy. just update the NS3_PATH value in settings.py and type
        $ ./sim
